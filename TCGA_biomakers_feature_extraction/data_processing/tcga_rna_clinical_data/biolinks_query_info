Uses GDC API to search for search, it searches for both controlled and open-access data. For GDC
data arguments project, data.category, data.type and workflow.type should be used For the legacy
data arguments project, data.category, platform and/or file.extension should be used. Please, see the
vignette for a table with the possibilities.

# GDC Workflow type:

DNASeq Harmonization Workflow
The GDC DNASeq Harmonization workflow is used for harmonization of genomic data to the GRCh38 reference genome.
This can be helpful when files within a data cohort are not aligned to the same reference, and it can be used
to harmonize all data to the most up-to-date version of the genome. The steps within the workflow are to first
convert a BAM input file to a FASTQ file, aligns the file to the GRCh38 reference genome using BWA, remove duplicates
with Picard MarkDuplicates and processes the BAM file using GATK BQSR. The tool was modified by the Seven Bridges
team for optimal performance in the cloud and for ease of use, without impacting the output of the tool. More info
on running the DNASeq Harmonization workflow can be found here.

RNASeq Workflow
The GDC RNASeq workflow is used for alignment and quantification of RNA-Seq data to look at expression changes between
samples. It takes either unmapped BAM or FASTQ files as inputs, uses STAR to align sequencing reads to the reference
genome, and uses HTSeq to count sequencing reads based on the annotation file. Raw read counts are then normalized using
two similar methods: FPKM and FPKM-UQ. More information on the RNASeq workflow can be found in the GDC documentation.

Tumor Only Variant Calling Workflow
The GDC Tumor Only Variant Calling workflow is used for variant calling on a tumor sample that does not have a matched
normal sample. This method takes advantage of the normal cell contamination that is present in most tumor samples in
order to differentiate between somatic and germline variation. These calls are made using the version of MuTect2 included
in GATK4. Tumor-only variant call files can be found in the GDC Portal by filtering for “Workflow Type: GATK4 MuTect2”.
The GDC Tumor Only Variant Calling Workflow harmonizes the file with VCF files in the TCGA dataset.
